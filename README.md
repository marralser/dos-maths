No-nonsense) Elementary Maths practice for DOS, V0.1, 08/24
for the Book 8088

This intentionally super simple, basic  Maths practicing program was born out of the need, that my 8-year old daughter needed to practice her basic maths skills. A lot, and during our Holidays. 
I was loooking for a solution with minimal distraction :-)

The idea of the programs is thus to avoid any distractions modern computers offer, to set clear goals, and to keep the attention span of the student up. 
The latter is achieved in the way that after every correct answer, a joke or a fun fact is displayed. These are stored in a simple text file 'jokes.txt'. 
(The fun scientific facts worked much better on my daugther compared to the jokes. ). It worked well for my daugther, and I had fun programming it.

The little special thing about this software is that it was written in 2024 using TurboC on unusual hardware: While a first version was started on an Amstrad PC1640 from 1987, 
the program was effectivley generated - written and compiled - on a Book8088 (v1), a 2023 XT 'netbook style'clone  with a CGA graphics adapter. 
It may thus well be the only software ever developed on the Book8088 :-). It has thus minimal system requirements, even if considering the early DOS era. 
I present here a german and an english bilingual version.

Licence: CCBY,, doubt anyone else will ever use this program other than us :-)  But if you will- or even have suggestions, or want to develop it further - please write to me or get staret!. 
One could develop an aducational software suite for the Book8088 and its successors.

This text has been written in August 2024 on the Book8088 (V1) using MS Word 4.0 and Word Perfect 5.1., both for DOS.
